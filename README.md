# WSL2 Compacter ðŸ—œ

## A small script for Windows 10 Home users to compact their WSL2 disks

Inspired by [this post on GitHub about WSL2 filling hard disks](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4699#issuecomment-627133168). This script will:

 - Find your `vhdx` file 
 - Shut down WSL2
 - Compact the disk with diskpart
 
After that just open another Linux termnal and WSL2 will restart automatically.

## Warning

1. I am a strange man on the internet asking you to run a powershell script. You should probably look inside the script [`compact-wsl2-disk.ps1`](compact-wsl2-disk.ps1) and make sure you understand what it does.

2. This will stop WSL. So save your work in Linux.

## Usage

Open Powershell as Administrator and run:

`powershell.exe .\compact-wsl2-disk.ps1`
